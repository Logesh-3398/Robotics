Overview
For this assignment, you will develop a MATLAB program to analyze the field of view of a robotic dinosaur's camera, ensuring it always encompasses a specific window aimed at viewing 
visitors. You will also calculate the minimum distance from the camera to the window throughout the dinosaur's operation.
Problem 1: Camera Field of View Analysis
Task Description
1.	Field of View Check:
o	Objective: Determine if the camera installed at point F on the dinosaur mechanism always included the window (GH) in its field of view throughout the day.
o	Approach: Using the data from six joint sensors collected every second (available in encoder.txt), calculate the orientation of the camera. Check if any part of the window falls within 
the camera's 60-degree field of view.
o	Output: Generate a plot where the signal is '1' if the window is within the field of view and '0' otherwise.
2.	Minimum Distance Calculation:
o	Objective: Compute the minimum distance from the camera to the window throughout the operational period.
o	Method: Utilize the positions and orientations derived from the joint encoders to calculate the distance from point F to the window at each sampled time point.
Requirements
•	Matlab Code:
o	Create MATLAB functions and scripts necessary to perform the above analyses. Ensure that the main script, main.m, when executed, should display the required results and plots without 
additional input or alteration.
•	Visualization:
o	The result plot should match the template provided (similar to Fig. 2 in your assignment prompt). This includes axes, legends, and other plot characteristics.
•	Documentation:
o	Include a detailed description of the methods and algorithms used to solve the problems. Explain how the data was processed, how calculations were performed, and any assumptions made.
o	Ensure the numerical result for the minimum distance is displayed clearly in the MATLAB command window.
